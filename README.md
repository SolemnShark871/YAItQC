# YAItQC: Yet Another Introduction to Quantum Computing 

A series of Jupyter notebooks intended to be merged into a Jupyterbook at a later date.This is intended as a basic introduction to quantum computing for a non-specialist (assuming no undergraduate physics experience) audience. Some preliminary mathematics will be covered in chapter 3 making this an almost completely self-contained guide. 

The intended audience should have a basic understanding of trigonometry and linear algebra including vectors and matrices as well as a curious and creative attitude to learning. 

## Recommended Reading 

Rather than *standing on the shoulders of giants* this work sits on a pile of textbooks, YouTube channels and online resources. In particular, a reader may benefit from the following materials: 

Great introduction materials:


- [Introduction to Classical and Quantum Computing, Thomas G Wong](http://www.thomaswong.net/introduction-to-classical-and-quantum-computing-1e2p.pdf)
- [Quantum Country, Andy Matuschak and Michael Nielsen](https://quantum.country/)
- Q is for Quantum, Terry Rudolph (Book, paid)


For more coding based understanding of QC:

- [The Qiskit Textbook](https://qiskit.org/textbook/preface.html) 
        - [Qiskit YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/qiskit)
- [Xanadu Quantum Codebok](https://codebook.xanadu.ai/) 
- [Quantum Computing UK](https://quantumcomputinguk.org/) (paid)


For those with more experience of physics and maths (undergraduate level)

- Quantum Computation and Quantum Information, Nielsen & Chuang 

Some chapters have exercise questions (with solutions being added) to help develop understanding. 

## Contributions are welcome!

Suggestions, corrections or any assistance is welcome. The first chapter is dedicated to thanking everyone for their contributions to this project.
