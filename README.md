# YAItQC: Yet Another Introduction to Quantum Computing

This project is intended as a basic introduction to quantum computing for a non-specialist (assuming no undergraduate-level experience) audience. Some preliminary mathematics will be covered in earlier chapters making this an almost completely self-contained guide The intended audience should have a basic understanding of trigonometry and linear algebra including vectors and matrices as well as a curious and creative attitude to learning.

## Recommended Reading

Rather than *standing on the shoulders of giants* this work sits on a pile of textbooks, YouTube channels and online resources. In particular, a reader may benefit from the following materials:

Great introduction materials:

- [Introduction to Classical and Quantum Computing, Thomas G Wong](http://www.thomaswong.net/introduction-to-classical-and-quantum-computing-1e2p.pdf)
- [Quantum Country, Andy Matuschak and Michael Nielsen](https://quantum.country/)
- Q is for Quantum, Terry Rudolph (Book, paid)

For more coding based understanding of QC:

- [The Qiskit Textbook](https://qiskit.org/textbook/preface.html)
  - [Qiskit YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/qiskit)
- [Xanadu Quantum Codebok](https://codebook.xanadu.ai/)
- [Quantum Computing UK](https://quantumcomputinguk.org/) (paid)

For those with more experience of physics and maths (undergraduate level)

- Quantum Computation and Quantum Information, Nielsen & Chuang

Some chapters have exercise questions (with solutions being added) to help develop understanding.

## Contributions welcome!

Quantum computing is built on a diverse range of perspectives, from engineering to physics, informatics and data science. Anyone who has an idea that might help is encouraged to open up an issue. Please do open up a pull request with any changes that might improve this project for everyone.
