# Acknowledgements

This educational text simply builds upon the inspiring work of a large number of visionaries. In addition, there are many great minds whose generosity in sharing their insights facilitated much of this work. It has been a great honour and privilege to have been supported in this endeavour. As an expression of gratitude, what follows is, in no particular order, a list of thanks:

To the people I had the great pleasure to work with at the finest IT company in Latin America, I am grateful to:

- Cris Diaz for his invaluable GitHub support
- Ivan Arie De Jesus Caballero Simbaqueba for his excellent feedback on chapter 1
- Carla Juliana Acosta Zamudio for some design suggestions,
- My first student who put up with me rambling through the first two chapters, Favio Acosta

To my first cohort of students, who not only survived my incoherent ramblings, finished my confusing assignments, but provided me with: 

- The many corrections to assignment 1, I give thanks to Giulio Malinverno, Andrés Felipe Guerrero, Rajat Kumar, Mahdi Sanagostar and Rajul Sharma.
- Pointing out the tensor product $\ket{0+}$ will not change under the standard $CNOT_{a,b}$, I give thanks to Rajat Kumar &  Andres Felipe Guerrero, this will help with chapter 6.
- An error in the general form of a single qubit gate before most people had attempted assignment 2, thank you, Andrés Felipe Guerrero González
- Additional corrections to assignment 2, I thank Mahdi Sanagostar
- A small but significant correction in Chapter 4, my thanks to Luis Javier Parra

For my friends in London who have provided me with both minor corrections and substantial philisophical insights:

- Thanking Eric (@Passawis) for his grammatical corrections to chapters 1,2,3... as well as his encouraging feedback.
- To Shaan Mehmood (@SM-3000), I give thanks for his advice on how to bring up the challenging question of interpretations of quantum mechanics. As well as his insights into classical Fourier transformes.
- As a humanities enthusiast who can't go without pointing out my spelling mistake(s) on the README itself, I am grateful for Chiara Seed.
