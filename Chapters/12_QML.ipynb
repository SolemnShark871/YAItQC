    "## What is Machine Learning \n",
    "\n",
    "In recent decades the rapid development of cheap and powerful classical processing units has transformed all aspects of society. Artificial intelligence has been pondered by humanity from as far back as the 1800's but has remained the realm of science fiction until numerous great advances in the capability of computers has facilitated many implementations of AI across various industries from medicine to the military. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many of these AI technologies are based on machine learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "### QC is a lot like machine learning \n",
    "\n",
    "There are quite a few similarities between quantum computing & machine learning. They are both:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Built on linear algebra\n",
    "- Held back by expensive computational resource\n",
    "- Sometmes very difficult to explain outcomes \n",
    "- Likey to go through period of hype & stagnation as technological development pace changes\n",
    "- Often associated with optimisation problems \n",
    "- Using Python & jupyter notebooks \n",
    "\n",
    "It's an open question as to whether or not quantum computing can improve machine learning. There have been some early experiments showing quantum machine learning performing better, but there have equally been experiments showing classical machine learning outperforming quantum machine learning. \n",
    "\n",
    " Given the very limited number (& quality) of qubits availible there haven't been any large-scale tests yet. This is likely to change in the near future...\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why machine learning could benefit from a quantum advantage\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few reasons motivating the use of quantum computers for machine learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Better sampling from true randomness of quantum states\n",
    "- Higher dimensionality from $2^n$ dimension only requiring $n$ qubits\n",
    "- Entanglement could be better for modelling correlations in joint-probability distributions\n",
    "- For data generated by quantum systems can be used much [more effectively on a quantum model](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn7293)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variants of QML \n",
    "\n",
    "### VQE\n",
    "\n",
    "The variational quantum eigensolver is one of the most well-known quantum algorithms. \n",
    "\n",
    "### QAOA \n",
    "\n",
    "### Generative Quantum Modelling\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quantum SVM \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Does ML need quantum?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When deciding whether to employ QML over the regular tried & tested ML, there are many deciding factors:`\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are no proven advantages to using QML over classical ML \n",
    "- Quantum computers struggle to load large classical datasets \n",
    "- Many proposed quantum algorithms depend on quantum ram, which has yet to be scaled and integrated into QPUs. \n",
    "- There is significant academic skepticsm, [even in commpanies that promote QML](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UsJV2BNj2U&list=PLOFEBzvs-VvppIb0jg5_aDbmFs36DXD9w)\n",
    "- If a classical ML solution works perfectly well for a given problem, it is much better to use that than a quantum version. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Some optimism: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Quantum machine learning is still a very new field. It may take quite some time to offer benefits, but that doesn't mean it isn't worth exploring.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Conventional ML also has limited theoretical performance guarantees, but we know it works really well in practice. Given there are so many diverse applications of ML, one of them is likely to be well-suited to a quantum model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Even if our current QML approaches don't offer any value at the moment, further research may uncover models better suited to the hardware we have now...\n",
    "\n",
    "- Whilst current hardware & algorithms are severely limited on the quantum side, progress is accelerating. Today's limitations may be overcome by tomorrow's breakthroughs that are hard to predict right now. This statement is generally true for all applications of quantum computing.\n",
