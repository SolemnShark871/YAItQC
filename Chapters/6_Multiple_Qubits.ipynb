    "## 6.1 More than the sum of its parts\n",
    "\n",
    "If quantum computing was nothing more than a collection of qubits processed individually, there would be little point in building a quantum computer. A single qubit can be modelled using 2x2 matrices - you can even work these out by hand! Even if we were to have a large number of these in parallel, it would still be very easy to simulate a large number of qubits. \n",
    "\n",
    "Having qubits interact with one another allows for more complex algorithms. Thanks to entanglement, one qubit can control what happens to another. This has some interesting implications for quantum algorithms. \n",

    "If we have multiple qubits, we can apply single qubit gates on each of them at a time. This is the same as having a bunch of single qubits on their own, each having their state changed by the qubit gate. The simplest case is two qubits. Let's begin with our qubits in the normal starting state of $\\ket{q_1q_0} = \\ket{00}$. We can apply a Hadamard gate on the first qubit, $q_0$ to change it to the superposition state $\\ket{+}$\n",

    "## 6.4 Product States\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.4.1 Pure States\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have acted on all our qubits separately, what happens to one doesn't affect the others. If we were to measure one of the qubits, it wouldn't tell us anything about the other qubits. \n",
    "\n",
    "Such states where we can separate the qubits out are called product states (or pure states). \n",
    "\n",
    "In general a product state can be written as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\ket{\\Psi} = \\ket{\\psi_0}\\ket{\\psi_1}...\\ket{\\psi_{n-1}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we measure the first qubit (qubit 0) and get a 0. The remaining qubits wouldn't be affected, so our new state would be \n",

    "\n",

    "### 6.4.2 The Tensor Product \n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically there is a very satisfying way of representing this with linear algebra. The tensor product allows us to do this. This is a little beyond the scope of this course, but I'll include it anwyay. \n",
    "I've been a bit lazy with notation here, is\n",
    "$$ \\ket{\\psi_0}\\ket{\\psi_1} = \\ket{\\psi_0} \\otimes \\ket{\\psi_1} $$\n",
    "Where the symbol $\\otimes$ represents the tensor product operation. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we use vectors to represent this it looks like \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\ket{\\psi_0} = \\begin{bmatrix} a_0 \\\\ a_1 \\end{bmatrix} ; \\ket{\\psi_1} = \\begin{bmatrix} b_0 \\\\ b_1 \\end{bmatrix} $$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a new vector with $\\ket{\\psi_1}$ repeated twice, each time multiplied by a scalar $b_0$ or $b_1$. The final vector has 4 elements and looks like: \n",

    " \\ket{\\psi_0} \\otimes \\ket{\\psi_1} = \\begin{bmatrix} a_0 b_0 \\\\ a_0 b_1 \\\\ a_1b_0 \\\\ a_1 b_1 \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So you can think of your new state as a 4-level quantum system. Every time we add another qubit, we tensor product it in, so the size of the vector doubles. This is where the exponential scaling of the state-space comes from.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same applies for multiple quantum gates in parallel. Our matrix increases by a factor of 2 in both the number of rows and columns. This is even better scaling!\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.5 Entangled States \n",
    "\n",
    "You might have noticed that it's really easy to apply single qubit gates to a collection of qubits. In the last chapter, we saw that all single qubit gates can be represented by $ 2 \\times 2$ matrices. And each qubit can be represented by a column vector with 2 rows. So if we had a large number of qubits, we could still simulate a large number of $2 \\times 2$ matrices on a classical computer. If it is easy to simulate a collection of isolated qubits, why do we bother making quantum computers? \n",
    "\n",
    "The answer comes from combining superposition with entanglement. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.5.1 If statements with spicy sauce \n",
    "\n",
    "In general programming, if statements allow you to include logic in a program. If a statement is true, the algorithm will do one thing, otherwise, if the statement is false, it will do something else. The computer first has to check the variables value before executing the next step of the algorithm. We can do this on a quantum computer by measuring our qubits, collapsing the superposition and then performing our next quantum gates accordingly. For example, [in quantum teleportation this is done](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-algorithms/teleportation.html). \n",
    "\n",
    " For example, in section 4.3.1 there was a game where if a coin landed up we got +1 dollar, otherwise (if it were tails up) we got -1 dollars. This works as a classical if statement, provided we add the value after the coin is landed and observed. \n",
    "\n",
    "What makes quantum operators different is that we can apply them to the superposition. What this means is we can act on both the $\\ket{H}$ and $\\ket{T}$ amplitudes at once. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> Entanglement allows the superposition of one qubit to define the superpotion of another\n",
    "\n",
    "This means we can't treat our qubits as separate 2x1 vectors anymore. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.5.2 Can the qubit not? \n",
    "\n",
    "Entanglement can be created by gates that act on multiple qubits together. This can create an entangled state. The most common way this is done is by using a 2 qubit gate called the controlled-not, usually shown as CNOT or CX. The CNOT acts on two qubits, the control qubit and the target qubit. If the control qubit is in the state $\\ket{0}$, it will do nothing, if the control qubit is in the state $\\ket{1}$ it will perform the not (X) gate on the target qubit. In both cases, the state of the control qubit is unchanged. \n",

One where qubit 0 is the target and qubit 1 is control or the other way around, qubit 1 is the control and qubit 0 is the target. Each of these has a different 4x4 matrix\n",
