    "# 5 Single Qubits & the Bloch Sphere  \n",
    "\n",
    "Having covered what quantum states are, this chapter will cover qubits and how we can control them. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 5.1 The unit of information\n",
    "\n",
    "Having introduced some of the basic mathematics to describe quantum computing, let's get started. \n",
    "\n",
    "Almost all articles or news reports talking about quantum computing start off by explaining how qubits are different from classical bits. This chapter will use the maths from previous chapters to give a better description of these qubits. \n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier, the coin example was introduced with the heads & tails outcomes we can observe. A qubit also has 2 outcomes called $\\ket{0}$ & $\\ket{1}$, we can just replace $\\ket{H}$ with $\\ket{0}$ and $\\ket{T}$ with $\\ket{1}$. \n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "These two states make up the computational basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as with the coins, our qubits can be in a superposition of $\\ket{0}$ & $\\ket{1}$. Unlike the coins, we can have any probability of measuring $\\ket{0}$ & $\\ket{1}$ (so long as all the probabilities are real positive numbers which add to 1). \n",
    "\n",
    "## 5.2 The Bloch Sphere \n",
    "\n",
    "Dirac notation is really useful for doing algebra with quantum states. We can model how the qubits change using vectors and calculate probabilities with the inner product. One limitation of Dirac notation is that it is difficult to visualise quantum states as it does not have a diagram to represent the state vector on. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Bloch sphere is a useful tool used to represent the state of a qubit. Below, the quantum state $\\ket{\\psi}$ is represented on the Bloch Sphere. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Bloch_sphere](Images/Bloch_Sphere.png) [1]\n",
    "\n",
    "At the top of the sphere  is the state $\\ket{0}$, at the bottom is the state $\\ket{1}$. Our state $\\ket{\\psi}$ is somewhere in between so it is a superposition of $\\ket{0}$ & $\\ket{1}$. The closer $\\ket{\\psi}$  is to the top, the greater the probability of measuring $\\ket{0}$, the same is true for the bottom with $\\ket{1}$. The angle $\\theta$ between the $\\ket{0}$ & $\\ket{\\psi}$ gives us these probabilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how $\\ket{0}$ and $\\ket{1}$ are separated by $180\\degree (\\pi)$ on the sphere, but they are perpendicular, so the angle between them is actually $90\\degree (\\pi/2)$. The angles on the Bloch sphere are twice as large as the angles for the qubits.\n",

    "\n",

    "The z-axis is where the $\\ket{0}$ & $\\ket{1}$ are, for that reason the z-axis is known as th computational basis. In addition we have the x & y axis which correspond to different states. \n",

    ">\n",
    ">We know the superposition state $\\ket{+}$ has equal probabilities of $\\ket{0}$ & $\\ket{1}$. Where on the Bloch sphere would this state be represented? What is the angle $\\theta$ that would describe this state?\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5.3 It's not just a phase!\n",
    "\n",
    "To show probabilities, a single angle is enough. So why do we need a sphere? \n",
    "\n",
    "There is another important parameter that describes a qubit: the phase. \n",
    "\n",
    "At last, our coins will not work to describe phase, there is no analogue in classical computing, nor in probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two quantum states can have the same probabilities, but be completely different states.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, earlier the flip coin operator $F$ had this form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F =  \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & -1 \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In quantum computing, this operator is known as a __Hadamard gate__ with symbol $H$. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we apply $H$ to $\\ket{0}$ we get the superposition state \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H\\ket{0} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} ( \\ket{0} + \\ket{1}) = \\ket{+}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying it to $\\ket{1}$ gives us a different superposition state: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H\\ket{1} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} ( \\ket{0} - \\ket{1}) = \\ket{-}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We call this state $\\ket{-}$ because of the minus sign between the $\\ket{0}$ & $\\ket{1}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of getting $\\ket{0}$ or $\\ket{1}$ is the same for both. If we were to measure either state, we would get 0 half the time and 1 the other half the time. Since the measurement gives the same outcome you might think they are the same state. \n",
    " \n",
    "They are different states, and surprisingly there is an easy way for us to tell which one we have. \n",
    "\n",
    "What happens if we apply $H$ on these states? \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ H\\ket{+} = H \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} ( \\ket{0} + \\ket{1})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (H\\ket{0} + H\\ket{1})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\ket{0} + \\ket{1})+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\ket{0} - \\ket{1}))  \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The $\\ket{1}$'s cancel each other out and the $\\ket{0}$ add together to give us\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ = \\ket{0} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "So if we apply $H$ once to $\\ket{0}$ we get $\\ket{+}$ and then applying it again goes back to $\\ket{0}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "This implies applying $H$ twice does nothing. $H^2 = I$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if we ever have $\\ket{+}$ we apply $H$ and get $\\ket{0}$ 100% of the time. If we get $\\ket{1}$ we must have had another state to begin with. If we had $\\ket{-}$ would measure 1 100% of the time. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">### Exercise 5.2 Back to the start\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Apply $H$ twice to $\\ket{1}$ and verify the state we end up with is $\\ket{1}$. \n",
    "\n",
    ">### Exercise 5.3 The coin doesn't work\n",
    ">\n",
    "> When we apply the Hadamard twice to a state, we get the same state back. Without doing any maths, consider throwing a coin. Why does throwing the coin twice not guarantee you get back the side you started with?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, where is the phase? \n",
    "\n",
    "The phase is contained in the + or - sign between the $\\ket{0}$ & $\\ket{1}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The phase can be more than just $\\pm 1$, it can be any complex number with magnitude 1. In general, any quantum state can have a phase $\\phi$ \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\alpha\\ket{0} + \\beta e^{i\\phi}\\ket{1} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "With $ 0 \\leq \\phi < 2\\pi $\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use what we know from the Bloch Sphere to write $\\alpha$ & $\\beta$ in terms of the angle $\\theta$\n",

    "$$ \\cos{(\\theta/2)}\\ket{0} + \\sin{(\\theta/2)} e^{i\\phi}\\ket{1} $$\n",

    "\n",
    "Remember Euler's formula (section 3.1.2) which allows us to convert from the exponential to the complex number\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ e^{i \\phi} = cos(\\phi) + i sin(\\phi) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example. if we choose the angles $\\phi = 0$ & $\\theta = \\pi/2$ we get $e^0 = 1$, $\\cos(\\theta/2) = \\sin(\\theta/2) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$. These angles correspond to the state $ \\ket{\\psi} = \\cos{(\\theta/2)}\\ket{0} + \\sin{(\\theta/2)} e^{i\\phi}\\ket{1} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (\\ket{0} + 1\\ket{1}) = \\ket{+} $.\n",
    "\n",
    "The phase is also shown on the Bloch sphere. In the above diagram the state $\\ket{\\psi}$ is described by two angles $\\theta$ describing the probabilities of measuring 0 or 1 and $\\phi$ describing the phase. The angle $\\phi$ corresponds to a rotation by $\\phi$ around the z-axis in the Bloch sphere.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Phases can be used to encode information, such as with the quantum Fourier transform, or to mark out quantum states (as with Grover's algorithm). \n",
    "\n",
    "> Phases only matter when they are relative. This means a phase difference between the different states. \n",

    "- Qudits present even more engineering challenges than qubits. For instance, a qubit in a trapped ion might consist of the ground state energy level and the first excited state. Higher energy levels have smaller gaps in energy, so they are more sensitive to smaller energy fluctuations. This makes qudits more difficult to control precisely. \n",
