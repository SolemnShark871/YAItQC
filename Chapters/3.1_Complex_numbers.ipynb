    "# Chapter 3: Maths for Quantum Computing\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand quantum computing one must speak the language of quantum computing, and that language is written in mathematics. Whilst this work is not intended to be a textbook on mathematics, it is worth outlining the core maths essential to understanding quantum computing. Readers familiar with complex numbers and linear algebra may find this material rather basic but may still appreciate the explanations and relationships between the topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter is split into two parts: Part 1 covers complex numbers and part 2 covers linear algebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3 Part 1  Complex numbers \n",
    "\n",
    "The first part of this chapter will cover some trigonometry and complex numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.1 Beyond real numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "So far everything in this textbook has been described using *real* numbers- that is the set numbers you can produce on most calculators. For quantum computing, we require going beyond to complex numbers. You may be wondering why we need imaginary numbers. The most important equation in all of quantum mechanics, the Schrodinger equation, features imaginary numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial{}}{\\partial{t}}\\ket{\\psi} = \\hat{H}\\ket{\\psi} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $i = \\sqrt{-1}$, $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planc constant, $\\hat{H}$ is a special operator called the Hamiltonian, and $\\ket{\\psi}$ is the statevector for the quantum system. \n",
    "\n",
    "This equation describes how quantum systems change with time. Whilst it is very important for quantum mechanics, it is not needed for this introductory course. Neither will there be any calculus.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1.1 The square root of -1 \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two square roots of $4$: $+2$ \\& $-2$. For numbers that aren't integers there are algorithms we can run on our calculators to work out the roots to arbitrary precision. In physics there are many situations in which the only valid solution to an equation calls for the square root of a negative number. To make this work, it is necessary to first define the square root of $-1$ as $i = \\sqrt{-1}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using some basic algebra we can factorise any surd (square root number) into a product of two surds $ \\sqrt{ab} = \\sqrt{a} \\times \\sqrt{b}$. This holds true for negative numbers allowing us to take the square root of any negative number by breaking it down into the square root of $-1$ and the positive magnitude of that number. This can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sqrt{-a} = \\sqrt{-1} \\times \\sqrt{a} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sqrt{-a} = \\pm i \\sqrt{a} $$\n",
    "For example the square root of $-4$ can be written as $+2i$, $-2i$.\n",
    "These numbers that can be written as $ai$ are known as imaginary numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1.2 Complex numbers \n",
    "\n",
    "Imaginary numbers work similarly to the real numbers everyone uses on a  daily basis. One can divide, multiply, add & subtract them just as you can for real numbers. What this also means is that any of $ \\div ,\\times, +, - $ operations can be applied to a combination of both real and imaginary numbers. For instance, the positive root of $-4$, $2i$ can be added to $3$ as $3 + 2i $. Any such number that can be written as a sum of a real and imaginary number is called a *complex number*. More generally we can define this mathematically as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ z = a + ib $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $a$ and $b$ are purely real numbers. The real part of $z$ is known as $ Re(z) = a$ and similarly the imaginary component of is $ Im(z) = b$. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1.3 The Argand Diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "Complex numbers can be represented on a graph by splitting them into their real & imaginary parts. In the Argand diagram the x axis represents the real part and the y axis represents the imaginary part. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Argand_plane](Images/A_plus_bi.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "If a were negative, the real part would be negative so the arrow would point to the left instead. If b were negative, the imaginary part would be negative, so the arrow would point downwards instead. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">### Exercise 3.1\n",

    "\n",
    "### 3.1.3 Complex conjugate\n",
    "\n",
    "Every complex number has a real & imaginary part. By taking the imaginary part of the complex number and making it negative, we get the complex conjugate. For example if the complex number $z$ is \n",
    "\n",
    "$z = x + iy$ \n",
    "\n",
    "The complex conjugate would be $z^*$ written as \n",
    "\n",
    "$z^* = x - iy$ \n",
    "\n",
    "In the figure below the complex number $z$ is shown along with its complex conjugate. In this diagram $\\bar{z}$ is used rather than $z^*$ but it means the same thing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![Complex_conjugate](Images/Complex_conjugate_picture.svg.png)\n",
    " [3]\n",
    "\n",
    " Note how the real part is the same, but the imaginary part is on the negative axis. \n",
    "\n",
    " ### 3.1.4 Magnitude of complex numbers \n",
    "\n",
    " It can be very useful to describe how big a complex number is. Since it has a real component and an imaginary component, the magnitude of a complex number indicates how big it is across both these components. \n",
    "\n",
    " The magnitude of a complex number $z$ is denoted by two vertical bars as $|z|$. It is calculated the same was as the Euclidean distance as \n",
    "\n",
    " $$|z| = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    " With $z = x + yi$. \n",
    "\n",
    " The magnitude of a complex number is important for figuring out the probability of getting an output from a quantum computation. This will be explored in the next chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### Exercise 3.2 \n",
    ">\n",
    "> Consider the complex number $z = 3 + 5i$ . \n",
    ">\n",
    "> i. What is the complex conjugate of $z$, $z^*$?\n",
    "> \n",
    "> ii. What is the magnitude of $z$?\n",
    ">\n",
    ">iii. What is the magnitude of $z^*$?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1.5 Interlude on Trigonometry \n",
    "\n",
    "Trigonometry is defined as \"*the branch of mathematics dealing with the relations of the sides and angles of triangles and with the relevant functions of any angles*\" but for our use it is much better to consider trigonometry the study of rotations. In later chapters, quantum gates will be described as rotations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a circle with radius 1. Any point on the circle can be reached by rotating on the surface by an angle. The figure below shows how we can reach any point.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Unit_circle](Images/TrigonometryUnitCircle_700.png)\n",
    "[2]\n",
    "\n",
    "The point P is reached by the angle $\\theta$. It has coordinates $x = \\cos(\\theta)$ and $ y = \\sin(\\theta)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In chapter 5, quantum gates will be described in terms of rotations around a higher dimensional sphere. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2.5 Euler's formula\n",
    "\n",
    "*Euler's formula* is very useful and can be stated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ e^{i \\theta} = cos(\\theta) + i sin(\\theta) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\theta$ is an angle in radians. \n",
    "\n",
    "The significance of this is that one can represent any complex number in this fashion simply by multiplying the left-hand side by some magnitude. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the complex number $ z = \\frac{1}{2}( 1 + \\sqrt{3}i)$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Can be written as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ z = cos(\\pi/3) + i sin(\\pi/3) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "With Euler's formula this becomes \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ z = e^{i \\pi/3} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of quantum information this object $ e^{i\\theta}$ is called a phase and is of exceptional importance. To explain why $\\theta$ is so significant would require its own chapter. Instead it shall be incorporated into later chapters as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2.6 Polar form of complex numbers \n",
    "\n",
    "We can represent any complex number on the **Argand diagram** in terms of its real and imaginary parts. From trigonometry, we can also represent any point on a circle using an angle and a given radius. \n",
    "\n",
    "Euler's formula allows us to put these two together, representing any complex number as a point on a circle. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Argand_Polar](Images/Polar_Argand-diagram.png)\n",
    "[4]\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some complex numbers that are too big to be written as $e^{i\\theta}$. For instance, the complex number z = 5 + 12i cannot be written as $cos(\\theta)$ because $cos(\\theta)$ only goes up to 1. To overcome this, we can multiply by some magnitude to allow for bigger numbers. By multiplying by 13 we can write \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ z = 13(cos(1.176) + i sin(1.176) )= 5 + 12i $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ z = 13e^{i 1.176}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where did the 13 come from? \n",
    "\n",
    "The factor in front of the $e$ is the magnitude of the complex number. This is the same magnitude described in 3.2.5. This is found by taking the norm of the real and complex part \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ 13 = \\sqrt{ 5^2 + 12^2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Euler's formula, any complex number can be written in terms of its magnitude and an angle. This gives us \n",
    "\n",
    "$$z = x + iy = re^{i\\theta}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Where $r$ is the magnitude of the complex number $r = |z| = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ and $\\theta$ is the angle made between the real and the imaginary plane\n"
